No matter their appearance, age, behavior, gender, professional and cultural background the person comes from, they can all be victims of suicide. So please, don&rsquo;t underestimate no cry for help.2. Whether there are people that care about you or not, your death will always break someone&rsquo;s heart.

And it&rsquo;s a very weird feeling to say that because this whole week I was planning on not being alive right now. Last tuesday I had a huge fight with my boyfriend after weeks of feeling unloved, ignored and in general completely isolated and lonely. I had no one to talk to, despite having many people. I just couldn&rsquo;t.  I had a horrible week and binged badly and that&rsquo;s where I made the plan to jump off a bridge after my therapists appointment. I ate a lot today because I thought what does it matter now? I won&rsquo;t be here tomorrow anyway. I watched my moms favourite videos with her whilst sharing breakfast because I thought it was the last moment we&rsquo;d share together and looking back at it makes me cry so hard. I&rsquo;m still here. I told my best friend that I was going to go and tried to say goodbye to her but ended up confessing my plans and she tried to talk me out of it. Which she did. Now,  a call with a crying and concerned boyfriend later, I feel even worse than before. I feel like I&rsquo;m a burden again and honestly I feel like a failure because I didn&rsquo;t went through with my plans.  My boyfriend thinks I&rsquo;m sleeping but in reality, I&rsquo;m sitting here with my pills and a knife wondering if I should just go through with it. I feel like a failure for not killing myself and that it would maybe be better if I just end it now.","Author":"wannabe-alices-diary","URL":"https://wannabe-alices-diary.tumblr.com/post/178520943701/tw","Likes":"23","Views":"0","Direct_Post":"0"},{"Keyword":"Depression","Platform":"Tumblr","Created_time":"1537918320","Title":"no title","Content":"You could say my cat is quite jealous of the girls.

Some people are made for shallow exchanges, and ridiculous banter, and nothing more. And that’s okay. That doesn’t make them horrible people because they simply aren’t able to handle a storm like you. It doesn’t make you a bad person because you won’t divulge all the gritty details of your horror show. It makes you smart. You have to accept that there will be people that cannot give you what you need. It doesn’t mean they are not worth keeping in your life. You just have to figure out who these ones are before you’re disappointed. And you have to keep them at arm’s length. You cannot expect everyone in your life to understand, to be nonjudgmental, to get it. But that’s okay, because not everyone was made to impart wisdom, or wax-poetic, or speak on politics and the depravity of society, or discuss how crucial it is that the stigma of mental illness be abolished. There are times when you have to get away from all that heaviness. You have to. And you will need superficial conversation about Kim Kardashian’s arse, or a debate on the colour of The Dress.

I think it’s amazing that when people think you have it all, in reality none of it means anything when you feel so depressed that you feel worthless to the world. This is what depression is like, you can have it all and still feel at the bottom of a pit that you can’t escape, and so much as a smile hides the pain and people walk on by, because nobody will truly understand the profound sadness that you feel inside, we are the quiet ones, the ones who turn down nights out with friends, the ones who stay quiet at family functions, the ones who say I’m fine and everybody keeps walking completely convinced. Life isn’t easy but we keep on fighting, hoping that our purpose will show eventually and we will find that end game, to all of you who can relate to this, stay strong, keep fighting, the end will come.","Author":"shadowofhatred","URL":"https://shadowofhatred.tumblr.com/post/179301223477/i-think-its-amazing","Likes":"35","Views":"0","Direct_Post":"0"},{"Keyword":"Depression","Platform":"Tumblr","Created_time":"1540021045","Title":"no title","Content":"I’m sorry that all I ever  bring is negativity.

This is simply my own diet.](Keep in mind that this is on the week days. I go to university from 5:50am to 7:00pm. Free hours at uni: 6-8:50am, 10am, 12pm, 3-4:50pm)Breakfast:8-10am: 3 gums. (I like Trident’s sugar-free, Bubblegum-flavored gum). If I’m too hungry, I’ll eat a single cookie.Lunch:12pm: Diet Coke (I do NOT finish it completely so I can save some for later)Excercise:3-5pm: I do dance practice by myself! (I don’t know how to dance..like..AT ALL, but it’s fun to do AND you burn calories. I do it at UNI at these hours since I’m free in those hours).Dinner:7pm: I usually do eat dinner. Something small and light. Maybe a soup or a bit of mashed potatoes. If I’m not THAT hungry, then I’ll either drink tea, a small cup of Fruit Punch juice, or another diet coke.However, if I’m REALLY REALLY hungry, I eat a full meal. I remind myself that my body needs food to survive, and that I’ve been restricting during the whole day so 1 meal can’t be THAT bad.Exercise:10/11pm: I just do basic, quiet exercises for about..20 to 30 minutes. I do them either at 10pm or 11pm.(When I’m really tired, I skip this part).Tips!✨• I always have thinspo with me.Whenever I feel hungry, I just look at the pics, and it reminds me to stick to my diet so I can reach my goal!• I read A LOT.It consumes most of my free time, so I usually forget that I haven’t eaten.• I listen to music.It makes me happy and makes me wanna dance, so it’s a win-win situation. I burn calories and I listen to something I like.If you are to try my diet:PLEASE, stay safe. If you feel like fainting or if you feel like it’s too extreme, please quit immediately and do eat something!

You roll over and hear every bone in your body grind against each other, the feeling of nausea hitting you as your body aches. You try to gracefully slide out of the blankets like all the thinspo but instead you collapse on to the floor because you haven’t eaten enough and you have no energy. You lie in a heap of bones, your head spinning as you try to ground yourself and get up. Your boyfriend isn’t there to help because he left you months ago, when he was so scared of losing you, he left to stop the ache of him finding you dead one day. Or maybe he stayed? Maybe he’s sitting next to you, crying, begging you to eat something with enough sugar to allow you to at least just sit up. But your corrupted mind say no; you’re too stubborn to give up. Eating disorders are not cute. Eating disorders are not some sort of “miracle” or “cure” for bullies telling you you’re fat, or you’re friends/family joking about your weight or maybe some other reason that lead you down the path of misery. So get out now while you can, don’t end up like me and other people you see on this god damn website. Some of us have a tendency to reblog thinspo and act like we’re okay and that we can’t wait to be thin, but we are all having a conflict in our head. We all have that voice that screams at you if you even look at food, you get to the point where you don’t even want to eat 100 calories in a day. Please, for your sake and everyone who loves you, speak to someone, get help. It is never too late, there’s always someone who will listen. I care, and so does everyone else. You’re worth more than what the scale says.","Author":"ftmskinandbones","URL":"https://ftmskinandbones.tumblr.com/post/177232275360/meanspothinspo","Likes":"45","Views":"0","Direct_Post":"0"},{"Keyword":"Depression","Platform":"Tumblr","Created_time":"1534763556","Title":"I NEED SLEEP","Content":"Insomnia: No sleep.Anorexia: Worry about my metabolism being “15% lower now”Depression: Even more tired than usual.Anxiety: I’m going to pass out from lack of sleep in front of everyoneBPD: Even more irritable and emotional than usual.Psychosis: Am I actually hallucinating or is this the sleep deprivation? ","Author":"ftmskinandbones","URL":"https://ftmskinandbones.tumblr.com/post/177197205300/i-need-sleep","Likes":"395","Views":"0","Direct_Post":"0"},{"Keyword":"Depression","Platform":"Tumblr","Created_time":"1531216272","Title":"no title","Content":"Having friends is fun but have you ever stayed in your room all day, everyday crying yourself to sleep and not eating anything?","Author":"ftmskinandbones","URL":"https://ftmskinandbones.tumblr.com/post/175739959290/having-friends-is-fun-but-have-you-ever-stayed-in","Likes":"2224","Views":"0","Direct_Post":"0"},{"Keyword":"Depression","Platform":"Tumblr","Created_time":"1531125504","Title":"reasons to stay alive","Content":"flowerais:you can visit your dream cities.\nyou can create things and inspire people.

Not to Peter, or the boys, because even the most heartfelt words buried deep down inside you couldn’t describe how sorry you were.\nHow much you wished you didn’t have feel this way.  Like you had to end it.\nYou imagined the lost boys rising early, perhaps for a morning hunt, springing into action after realizing that you had vanished into thin air. They would eventually notice the one thing left of your ever being there; a small, glass bottle filled with the very last of the pixie dust that Pan had given you.\n“Here, I want you to take this.” Peter had whispered, slipping a small bottle into your palm, looking both relieved and hopeful after giving it off to you. “It’s all the pixie dust I have left, and at least I know with you, it’s in good hands.” Peter cleared his throat, meeting your eyes. “ But I want this to be more than just a gift I’ve given you,” he said in a hushed tone, placing a gentle hand on your bare knee, waiting patiently for you to answer,\nIn the dim light of the half moon, you could make out the worry lines deeply etched into his cheeks and forehead. You could hear the loud thumping of his heart in his chest, the quickness of his breath fanning out into the night air.\nFinally, you nodded silently, urging Peter to continue.\n“Let this be a promise. A promise to me that you won’t give up on hope, on us, on life. A promise that you won’t leave, because god knows what will become of me. A promise that you, y/n, will keep.” And that night, you had promised Peter.\nBut deep down, you knew that this was a promise you couldn’t keep.\n        Now, sunrise is approaching, and all you have is yourself.  No pixie dust. No baggage. No Peter. \nSitting on the damp bank beside the river with your legs hanging into the cold water of the sparkling river, you think to yourself, “What if I had said goodbye?” But going over everything that has happened in your life is too painful, especially when it comes to the thought of Peter. \nInstead, you planned to savor your last sunrise, breathe in the scent of Neverland and it’s infinite beauty. Watch as the sun’s dim glow casts pink and yellow hues across the sky and bright beams of light into the river and over the waterfall, making it look easier to slip into the ravenous jaws of the deadly beast willingly.\nThe sky lightens, the birds begin singing. Neverland is awake.\nIt's time.\nSlowly, you take in your surroundings one last time, burning each and every detail into your mind, from the trees to the dirt, so maybe in another life, you would remember this place like the back of your hand. The water ice cold against your bare ankles when you first step in, getting even more numbly as it rises up past your knees.  A school of small fish begins to circle your feet as if they are trying to stop you from making a choice that you can’t ever reverse. \nThe further in you go, the deeper and rougher the water becomes. The rocks become slick and slippery, your heart the only thing you hear in your ears. Thump. Thump. Thump\nBut, for once, finally, you feel free. Not like those times with Peter, when you both flew through the air like elegant birds, feeling the wind in your hair and joy in your hearts, or when you both ran wildly through the forest like animals, not having to worry about acting proper or being gentlemanly. \nNo, this is a choice you can control, an outcome you can control. This is something that will silence the painful ache in your soul forever, and that’s what you want the most.\nEven more than Peter.\nThe water grows angrier, splashing harshly in every direction, and this now, you know, will be your last moment on earth. The time feels right.\n You close your eyes, put a hand over your racing heart. Another painful memory is pulling at your strings. A reminder of your promise to Peter.\n“This,” Peter had said, teary-eyed one night after he had been informed by one of the older lost boys that you had muttered something to yourself about what it would feel like to drown. “This is called a purpose.” He enclosed his warm hand around your arm, putting a finger to your wrist, finding the pulse in your veins. “This belongs to a living, breathing human being, and that human being is you.” \nYou had been so deep in thought that you hadn’t realized your body was one step ahead of your mind, and you have moved a few steps ahead of where you had previously been, only this time, the rocks grow slick and the ground beneath you begins to steep. \nOne step later, one of your feet slips out from beneath you, throwing you into the furious waters. Everything is a blur.\nYou are sucked under, a mess of flailing arms and feet. You don’t feel anything then, physically or emotionally, you just watch the world, the life you could’ve had, pass you by in a matter of seconds. But, after what seemed like hours, you remember. \nYou’re not a lost girl. But that’s exactly who you are right now, and she is not who you want to be. You stare up toward surface above you, holding your breath for the longest time. Your lungs being to burn, your body begins to protest. Then, you let out your last breath.\nYou gasp for air, but all you get are mouthfuls of water, and you can feel your life slipping away, out of your grasp. You are slowly drowning. It might have been a minute or two before you feel a heavy pressure on your body, a hand pulling at your wrist.\n“This is what a second chance feels like,” your mind whispers.\nThen miraculously, you are pulled up and out of the water so swiftly like a gull catching its prey. At first, you had thought you had been dreaming. But once you weakly find the strength to open your eyes, you catch sight of a blurry pair of emerald green eyes.\n“No, you’re not a lost girl.”\n Peter.\n Before darkness overtook you and your mind began to go black, you heard him whisper one last thing as he cradled you carefully in his arms like a fragile jewel, kissing your wet hair. \n“And I intend to keep it that way.”\n","Author":"numbgirlsprinkle","URL":"https://numbgirlsprinkle.tumblr.com/post/179359980134/lost-girl-peter-pan-part-2","Likes":"35","Views":"0","Direct_Post":"0"},{"Keyword":"Depression","Platform":"Tumblr","Created_time":"1532950832","Title":"no title","Content":"numbgirlsprinkle:\n\nI hate myself because I know I’m not fat, but I feel fat, and I just want to starve myself.","Author":"numbgirlsprinkle","URL":"https://numbgirlsprinkle.tumblr.com/post/176441473214/numbgirlsprinkle-i-hate-myself-because-i-know","Likes":"13","Views":"0","Direct_Post":"0"},{"Keyword":"Depression","Platform":"Tumblr","Created_time":"1540928589","Title":"no title","Content":"I&rsquo;d like to die without feeling pain.

If you don’t eat for more than 24hrs and still don’t lose a pound, don’t worry, you body stores fat for food so it’ll take longer to metabolisize. 16hr intermittent fasting always worked for me. My goal calorie everyday is 500, but I never go over 800. If you binge, it’ll actually help a lot. Just don’t go into days stretched of binging. Even when you binge, even when you’re hungry, WALK. It really helpsDo a lot of core for your stomach, because it’s always the hardest to loseDrink more water than you ever have in your entire life. The water you drink becomes water weight, and the pounds will just slide off. It’s always good to take your multivitamins. You’re not too thick to faint from not eating enough nutrients. For some reason, try to stay away from sugar. It sticks to your body the longest. I stuck to this the past three months. My goal sw was 230 lbs and I’m now 180. So it’s possible, most definitely possible.

FUCKING INCREDIBLE. i personally always put it in my tea and it makes me feel much fuller than if i had normal peppermint tea. you can get peppermint oil pretty much anywhere for pretty cheap. my mom uses essential oils daily so i always have a few bottles on hand.peppermint tea is also fucking great, (and tastes better than green tea if you don’t like the taste of that). it really helps with bloating, (drink a mug or two before bed), helps with nausea from fasting, aids in weight loss, relieves stress and HELPS WITH CRAMPS. it’s fucking great.EDIT: please check to make sure the peppermint oil you buy/have can be ingested! some have too many added chemicals and other ingredients!this has been a psa. peppermint oil &amp; tea. fuck yeah stay safe! feel free to message me at any time!","Author":"depressed-shark","URL":"https://depressed-shark.tumblr.com/post/179610401119/listen-here-you-little-shits","Likes":"3010","Views":"0","Direct_Post":"0"},{"Keyword":"Depression","Platform":"Tumblr","Created_time":"1540957788","Title":"no title","Content":"adreamofthin:\n\nTriggering Ana media 🥀Tv ShowsToo fat for fifteenInsatiableSupersize vs superskinny Dr Phil- Identical Twins, Anorexic WomanRed Band SocietySecret EatersMovies/ Documentary’s To the boneWorlds Worst Child AnorexicAnorexia Nervosa: Being too thinDying to be AnorexicSongsMrs Potato Head- Melanie MartinezIdontwanttobeyouanymore- Billie EilishSkinny Love- BirdySad- XXXTentacionDepression and Obsession- XXXTentacionA Team- Ed SheeranTeen Idle- Marina and the DiamondsFollow @adreamofthin for more 🖤","Author":"depressed-shark","URL":"https://depressed-shark.tumblr.com/post/179609388644/triggering-ana-media","Likes":"2961","Views":"0","Direct_Post":"0"},{"Keyword":"Depression","Platform":"Tumblr","Created_time":"1540704135","Title":"no title","Content":"No one cares about me.

CALORIE. EVERYTHING. there are SOOO many low calorie foods, they just require effort to make. take the 10 minutes to make yourself a 36 calorie pancake for breakfast over that 200 calorie eggo waffle. it’s worth it.\neat frozen fruits and vegetables. with or without ana, you can eat lots of fruits and veggies and not gain any weight. plus the frozen aspect of these foods will make you take longer to eat, which will make you full faster and less likely to binge.\nremember that if you do eat high calorie foods, eat small. control yourself, and if you win your portion battle remember that you’re doing great and will be thin in no time!!\nfor when you binge:\nwe all do this, even me, so know that it’s normal and you’re totally fine so long as you don’t do it often.\nDO NOT PURGE. if you can avoid it, please do. it’s better just to accept that you done fucked up and get on with life. tomorrow is a new day and you can start over then. for now just keep your food down.\npractice self care afterwards. i know you’re depressed and feel ugly, and as much as you hate your body right now you need to take care of yourself. go take a shower and cry it out. brush your teeth and stare at yourself in the mirror, thinking about how you’ll do better tomorrow. meditate in bed and let your mind focus on nothing else but the universe’s existence around you. things will pass and you will get stronger.\nfor when you need a community:\nit’s lonely having an ED, we all know. but you’re not alone with your thoughts or struggles. there are TONS of ED groupchats and forums where you can rant or vent in a safe way.\njoin a kik group. these groups usually ask for your calorie intake, or workout schedule, from the day and make you report everything you did to the others. they motivate you and console you in struggling times.\nmake an ana/mia/ortho/etc pal!! having someone close to you and floating in the same boat really helps your mental health while on your path to being thin.\npersonal message me, if you want. im always down for sending reminders to drink water, watch your calories, and take care of yourself. i also have mental health and emergency response training if you need advice or to vent :)\nfor when you’re overwhelmed by your disorder:\nbreathe in and out\nlay down and relax, don’t stress yourself out over something as trivial as your outward appearance\ntake a nap or shower\ngo outside and feel the ground. hear the animals. smell the fresh air. life is gorgeous, all around you. take in it’s complex beauty and focus on that instead of yourself.\nfor when ana gets ugly:\nana isn’t all fresh fruits and sun kissed skin stretching over exposed bones, it’s hunger pains and laying awake at night and losing hair and looking grey.\ntake hair skin and nail vitamins (pill form only as they have no calories) daily and in the exact dose as on the bottle (don’t take more it will overload your body). this will make the hair loss less noticeable and extreme, keep your skin looking sorta healthy and less acne ridden, and your nails strong-ish.\nsmell mint or something extremely overbearing when you have hunger pains. mint will automatically make the pains less noticeable and overbearing scents typically distract your senses.\nif you are a person who gets a period, make sure you take “women’s” vitamins (pill form, and even if you don’t identify as a woman) because you WILL fuck up your hormones with ana and WILL need these nutrients to stay stable.\ntry to drink a lot of water, and keep a bottle near you at ALL TIMES. drinking water isn’t just a meal replacement or to “make your mental health better”. i hate to say this but you need at least 3 litres of water a day. like this isn’t negotiable, especially if you have ana. it’s hard to realise how much hydration you get from food until you stop eating. because of this you will get dehydrated and could possibly die, or have to pay lots of medical bills. and if that doesn’t warn you enough: your skin will break out. bad. and not in a managable way. your acne will be painful and leave scars since your skin won’t be healthy enough to heal properly. but if you drink water these effects won’t be as extreme.\nANYWAYS\ni hope this helped you precious bbys!!! if you want any more advice or specific advice for specific scenarios (like these) shoot me an ask and you can garuntee there’ll be a post on it soon :)\nstay safe as always, and make sure to stay hydrated!!!!

I think it’s amazing that when people think you have it all, in reality none of it means anything when you feel so depressed that you feel worthless to the world. This is what depression is like, you can have it all and still feel at the bottom of a pit that you can’t escape, and so much as a smile hides the pain and people walk on by, because nobody will truly understand the profound sadness that you feel inside, we are the quiet ones, the ones who turn down nights out with friends, the ones who stay quiet at family functions, the ones who say I’m fine and everybody keeps walking completely convinced. Life isn’t easy but we keep on fighting, hoping that our purpose will show eventually and we will find that end game, to all of you who can relate to this, stay strong, keep fighting, the end will come.","Author":"shadowofhatred","URL":"https://shadowofhatred.tumblr.com/post/179301223477/i-think-its-amazing","Likes":"35","Views":"0","Direct_Post":"0"},{"Keyword":"Depression","Platform":"Tumblr","Created_time":"1540021045","Title":"no title","Content":"I’m sorry that all I ever  bring is negativity.

An eating disorder is not about what you eat, but how you eat- your feelings/thoughts about your body and your intake.\n“I’m not underweight!”The majority of people who develop an eating disorder will never become underweight. The only disorder that is diagnosed based partially on weight is anorexia- and for that, if you’re an average weight but meet every other criteria, you’ll still be diagnosed with ‘atypical anorexia nervosa’. It doesn’t mean you aren’t sick or that you don’t need help.\n“I don’t meet the anorexia/bulimia guidelines!”OSFED (formerly known as EDNOS) is not a ‘failed’ eating disorder. It is every bit as serious as anorexia or bulimia. It is also the most commonly diagnosed eating disorder, meaning more people have this than anorexia or bulimia.\n“I don’t make myself sick!”Vomiting is only one form of purging. You can have bulimia, anorexia or OSFED/ARFID and not make yourself sick.\n“I still eat!”So does everybody else. You can’t photosynthesise, after all. Even people with eating disorders eat.\n“I feel like a fake/ a fraud!”So does basically every single other eating disordered person. This is a really, really, really, really common feeling. You might feel guilty for ‘misleading’ other people into believing the problem is more serious than it is, or feel like you’re overblowing things. That’s totally normal and it is not true. You are not a fake or a fraud.\n“I eat things that no real anorexic would eat!”I have known eating disordered patients with these safe foods: chocolate, frozen meat pizza, fruit, ice cream cones, potatoes, granolaI have known eating disordered patients with these fear foods: : chocolate, frozen meat pizza, fruit, ice cream cones, potatoes, granolaSafe/fear foods are not based on logic or reason. They are individualised. There are even people who don’t have any fear foods- they’ll eat anything, they’ll just feel crappy and purge it/ restrict afterwards. All of the experiences described here are those of a person with an eating disorder.\n“I’ve never been inpatient!”Neither have most eating disorder sufferers.\n“I’ve never been tube fed!”Neither have most eating disorder sufferers.\n“I’ve never been near death!”Neither have most eating disorder sufferers.\n“My blood work/ blood pressure is fine!Eating disorders affect different bodies in different ways. Some people find their blood work suffers; others find their blood pressure or pulse dips; others find that, whilst they’re suffering hugely mentally, their bodies hold up well. This is not a measure of how ‘sick’ you are. All of these things- weight, bp, pulse etc- are just symptoms of the sickness. The sickness is in your head.\n“I don’t feel sick enough.”You never will. Sorry. “I’m not sick enough!” is one of the most common ED thoughts there is; please don’t listen to it. It is a lie. Do not compare your misery to someone else’s; nobody with stage I cancer says ‘yeah, but that person is a stage III, so I’m not really that bad and I won’t get any treatment yet’.\n“I still get my period!”‘Period loss’ has been removed from the DSM as necessary for a diagnosis of anorexia, and no other eating disorder requires it. It was viewed as a flawed measure of illness, and so it has been removed. Whether or not you get your period is not an indication of how ill you are.\n“But I binge eat without throwing up”Binge eating disorder is a newly added eating disorder in the DSM, where people eat large amounts of food in an ‘out of control’ manner but then do not compensate inappropriately for it. It is very much a real eating disorder.\n“I don’t calorie count/ weigh myself!”I know many people with eating disorders- including anorexia- who have never calorie counted, or who don’t own a pair of scales. It’s not required for diagnosis.\n“I think about food all the time!”This is a symptom of an eating disorder. Malnutrition causes the brain to focus 100% of its attention on food- finding it, getting it, eating it. Daydreaming or fantasizing about food does not mean you are not sick; quite the opposite, in fact.\n“But I enjoy eating!”Most people do. Eating is enjoyable. Even in the depths of my restriction, the food I ate brought me great pleasure. It’s linked to the previous point, to a certain extent. Enjoying food does not mean you don’t have an ED.\n“But this is just how I am!”Eating disorders often start in early childhood, and it can be hard to break out of a pattern that well-entrenched. It’s not impossible, though. Chronic eating disorders can be harder to beat, but they can be beaten.\n–\n(part of Mental Health Awareness week)\nFor more information on eating disorders and what to do if you think you have one, visit\nwww.b-eat.co.uk\nwww.webiteback.com\nhttp://www.something-fishy.org\nNHS- overcoming eating disorders\nwww.joyproject.org\n","Author":"butterflyxbones","URL":"https://butterflyxbones.tumblr.com/post/179550637881/but-i-cant-have-an-eating-disorder-because","Likes":"24550","Views":"0","Direct_Post":"0"},{"Keyword":"Depression","Platform":"Tumblr","Created_time":"1540586887","Title":"no title","Content":"The shit won&rsquo;t stop bleeding ah fuck this","Author":"butterflyxbones","URL":"https://butterflyxbones.tumblr.com/post/179461131551/the-shit-wont-stop-bleeding-ah-fuck-this","Likes":"3","Views":"0","Direct_Post":"0"},{"Keyword":"Depression","Platform":"Tumblr","Created_time":"1540585862","Title":"no title","Content":"I stopped cutting weeks ago, been clean since then.

This is simply my own diet.](Keep in mind that this is on the week days. I go to university from 5:50am to 7:00pm. Free hours at uni: 6-8:50am, 10am, 12pm, 3-4:50pm)Breakfast:8-10am: 3 gums. (I like Trident’s sugar-free, Bubblegum-flavored gum). If I’m too hungry, I’ll eat a single cookie.Lunch:12pm: Diet Coke (I do NOT finish it completely so I can save some for later)Excercise:3-5pm: I do dance practice by myself! (I don’t know how to dance..like..AT ALL, but it’s fun to do AND you burn calories. I do it at UNI at these hours since I’m free in those hours).Dinner:7pm: I usually do eat dinner. Something small and light. Maybe a soup or a bit of mashed potatoes. If I’m not THAT hungry, then I’ll either drink tea, a small cup of Fruit Punch juice, or another diet coke.However, if I’m REALLY REALLY hungry, I eat a full meal. I remind myself that my body needs food to survive, and that I’ve been restricting during the whole day so 1 meal can’t be THAT bad.Exercise:10/11pm: I just do basic, quiet exercises for about..20 to 30 minutes. I do them either at 10pm or 11pm.(When I’m really tired, I skip this part).Tips!✨• I always have thinspo with me.Whenever I feel hungry, I just look at the pics, and it reminds me to stick to my diet so I can reach my goal!• I read A LOT.It consumes most of my free time, so I usually forget that I haven’t eaten.• I listen to music.It makes me happy and makes me wanna dance, so it’s a win-win situation.

Try to understand where it came from. Why do you demand so much of yourself? Do you have tendencies towards perfection or self-hatred? If so, where do these come from?\n\n\n2. Practice self-compassion. Everyone deserves to be loved and understood, to be allowed to make mistakes, and to take the time to grow. Give that to yourself. Don’t attack and hurt yourself.\n\n\n3. Deliberately focus on positive self-talk. Being negative, impatient, critical and overbearing becomes so automatic that we don’t realize it’s a habit. So, interrupt that habit and be kind and positive.\n\n\n4. Decide not to compare yourself to others. We tend to judge ourselves by the people who excel, or have an easier life, or who face few obstacles. It’s not a level playing field so don’t compare yourself. Remember you ARE changing, and you have a lot to give.\n\n\n5. Make a note of compliments and nice things people say – then pull it out and read it when you start to feel you’ve failed. Remind yourself that others see your value and worth … And others see the good in you, and want you to succeed. \n","Author":"thelimerencelove","URL":"https://thelimerencelove.tumblr.com/post/179563558980/how-to-stop-beating-yourself-up","Likes":"1587","Views":"0","Direct_Post":"0"},{"Keyword":"Depression","Platform":"Tumblr","Created_time":"1540844700","Title":"no title","Content":"y-3llow:\n\n","Author":"thelimerencelove","URL":"https://thelimerencelove.tumblr.com/post/179563552420","Likes":"158","Views":"0","Direct_Post":"0"},{"Keyword":"Depression","Platform":"Tumblr","Created_time":"1540844691","Title":"no title","Content":"tessaxana:\n\n","Author":"thelimerencelove","URL":"https://thelimerencelove.tumblr.com/post/179563548490","Likes":"1260","Views":"0","Direct_Post":"0"},{"Keyword":"Depression","Platform":"Tumblr","Created_time":"1540844651","Title":"no title","Content":"kharah:\nyeah physically i’m weak but emotionally i’m weaker","Author":"thelimerencelove","URL":"https://thelimerencelove.tumblr.com/post/179563529610/kharah-yeah-physically-im-weak-but-emotionally","Likes":"39985","Views":"0","Direct_Post":"0"},{"Keyword":"Depression","Platform":"Tumblr","Created_time":"1540842640","Title":"no title","Content":"ill-starve-till-im-thin:\n","Author":"thelimerencelove","URL":"https://thelimerencelove.tumblr.com/post/179562565310","Likes":"2194","Views":"0","Direct_Post":"0"},{"Keyword":"Depression","Platform":"Tumblr","Created_time":"1540948960","Title":"no title","Content":"desacople:\n\nEn lo que a mi respecta, pueden irse tranquilamente a la concha de sus madres","Author":"a-g-o-r-a-p-h-o-b-i-a","URL":"https://a-g-o-r-a-p-h-o-b-i-a.tumblr.com/post/179605465110/desacople-en-lo-que-a-mi-respecta-pueden-irse","Likes":"1672","Views":"0","Direct_Post":"0"},{"Keyword":"Depression","Platform":"Tumblr","Created_time":"1540866918","Title":"no title","Content":"condoblell:\n\nme hago un lío en la cabezapensando que jamás sere suficienteque no importa cuánto esfuerzo ponga terminaré siendo la misma mierda que tanto me atormenta","Author":"a-g-o-r-a-p-h-o-b-i-a","URL":"https://a-g-o-r-a-p-h-o-b-i-a.tumblr.com/post/179574087510/me-hago-un-lío-en-la-cabeza-pensando-que-jamás","Likes":"950","Views":"0","Direct_Post":"0"},{"Keyword":"Depression","Platform":"Tumblr","Created_time":"1540866875","Title":"A mi las cosas no me duelen en el momento, me duelen cuando estoy sola.","Content":"","Author":"a-g-o-r-a-p-h-o-b-i-a","URL":"https://a-g-o-r-a-p-h-o-b-i-a.tumblr.com/post/179574066900/a-mi-las-cosas-no-me-duelen-en-el-momento-me","Likes":"29570","Views":"0","Direct_Post":"0"},{"Keyword":"Depression","Platform":"Tumblr","Created_time":"1540866834","Title":"no title","Content":"tedenaranjas:\n\ntengo penita\ny quiero llorar \ny que me abracen \ny no me hablen \nsólo que me abracen \ny me abriguen \nque este cuerpo \nesta alma \nes frágil","Author":"a-g-o-r-a-p-h-o-b-i-a","URL":"https://a-g-o-r-a-p-h-o-b-i-a.tumblr.com/post/179574047365/tedenaranjas-tengo-penita-y-quiero-llorar-y","Likes":"18649","Views":"0","Direct_Post":"0"},{"Keyword":"Depression","Platform":"Tumblr","Created_time":"1540866820","Title":"no title","Content":"carpediemtuvidadisfrutabien:\n\n“Si te hicieron daño no pienses que no vales nada.

On behalf of every broke Jewish grad student, I can vouch for the fact that this is 1000% acceptable and welcome.\n(3) You even thinking about giving to the Jewish community means a lot.

(Long post)","Content":"You seem pretty well versed on mental health issues, so I was hoping you could provice some advice!\nUsually, this is the kind of thing I’d bring to my therapist, but she is unfortunately on maternity leave at the moment. I know there’s a huge difference between some rando on Tumblr and a licensed therapist, but at this point, I’ll take whatever I can get. Even unprofessional advice might be helpful.\nI have GAD and I very likely have ADHD (legally undiagnosed, but my therapist is sure I have it and is trying to get me a diagnosis) as well as some other underlying mental health issues that I still have no fucking clue about. Like I mentioned, I see a therapist regularly most of the time, and I have been for over a year. So I should know what my symptoms are, right? RIGHT?!\nApparently not. Because recently I learned about a massive issue I’ve had for almost as long as I can remember. And, somehow, I have never noticed it until now.\nGet this: I rip up paper. And I connect my letters absentmindedly when I zone out. Sounds harmless, yes? It’s not.\nI have torn up pages of homework. I have taken handwritten essays that needed to be turned in the next day and “doodled” over them to the point that the letters are unrecognizable. When I was a kid, I would ruin the covers of my favorite books and then become furious over something that was my own fault. Most of my notebooks don’t have covers. All of my jackets have pockets full of shredded paper. I’ve literally failed tests when I knew the material because the paper I handed in just had a bunch of scribbles where the answers should have been. And a lot of the time I’ll even combine the two, finding old worksheets that I’ve ruined with my “doodling” and slowly tearing them to shreds.\nI thought it was stimming or self-soothing because it makes me feel calm. It’s viscerally satisfying in some arbitrary way, so yes, it does help with my anxiety. But what I didn’t realize is that it also causes anxiety. It isn’t just a coping mechanism. I am no longer in control of the situation. When I see a word I’ve written in a certain way, I need to connect all the lines. When a paper is creased, I need to rip it. When I don’t, I feel anxious and uncomfortable and… sort of twitchy. It’s like my whole being just wants me to do the destructive habit. I can’t not do it. I can’t stop thinking about it.\nI feel completely helpless and miserable. I know it’s just paper, I can just type, etc. But isn’t there something wrong? I’ve never heard of these types of symptoms, and I can’t really connect them to my ADHD or GAD, although maybe that’s just an oversight on my part. My point is that I really don’t know what’s going on, but I need help. Any advice at all is appreciated. Thank you.Hello there, dear!Oddly enough my therapist is on maternity leave too! So that bit made me smile. :)I’ll let you in on a little secret: It took me 9 years of seeing a therapist before I was finally diagnosed properly. From 16 - 26 I had been told I had Bipolar disorder, until someone finally realized I actually have Borderline Personality Disorder, or BPD.Mental health is like a journey with no map. Therapists are there to help you by giving you directions, or techniques, or to even help you discover those things on your own. But therapists can be wrong and point you in the wrong direction, or not know what direction you need. It takes quite some time to figure out the journey that is your illness, but I’m proud of you for what you’ve done so far!These things do seem like stimming to me, though I am no expert on it. From my understanding, however, stims can be both helpful and harmful. They help to deal with anxiety in the moment, but the after effects can cause that to backfire. It sounds like this struggle has become overwhelming. You may want to look into seeing a temporary therapist while yours is away on leave. Also, have you seen a doctor about medications? Not all medication for anxiety is good, but some of it can be very helpful.It’s not “just paper”. If it’s something you’re struggling with, then it’s an issue, and it matters. Something is clearly wrong and needs to be addressed.Are you still in school? If so, you may want to get your parents to look into an alternative learning program.. Speak with a school adviser / school counselor about finding teachers who are more understanding of the situation. Make sure you have someone advocating for you if there are issues.Try to narrow down what causes you to be stressed so you can learn to prepare for those situations. For example, if you are going to be taking a test, ask if you can have some extra notebook paper to quietly shred and doodle on so that you aren’t doing so on the test itself. Maybe get a new notebook specifically dedicated for your doodling/shredding, so you can avoid tearing apart any of your other ones. These will be conscious choices you will have to learn to make, but it will be much easier than just forcing yourself not to tear things. It might be difficult, but it will be worth it. Mental Health is about growing, one day at a time, one step at a time. You can also look into other sorts of stimming, be it toys or not. There are quite a few very nice stim toys online (Wish is where we got ours) and while it does take some getting used to, they are nice to keep your hands busy with. You can also do things like fold up bits of paper, or fidget with a piece of string/hair tie, etc. Something that isn’t disruptive or harmful to yourself or your life.I really hope this has been helpful. If anyone else with more experience with stimming has anything to add, please do!I love you and I really hope you’re able to get to a healthier place soon!- N","Author":"randomreasonstolive","URL":"https://randomreasonstolive.tumblr.com/post/179560952880/advice-long-post","Likes":"23","Views":"0","Direct_Post":"0"},{"Keyword":"Depression","Platform":"Tumblr","Created_time":"1540825233","Title":"Reason to Live # 1381","Content":"Cuddles from my dog make it worth living. - Guest Submission(Please don’t add negative comments to these posts.)","Author":"randomreasonstolive","URL":"https://randomreasonstolive.tumblr.com/post/179555067086/reason-to-live-1381","Likes":"125","Views":"0","Direct_Post":"0"},{"Keyword":"Depression","Platform":"Tumblr","Created_time":"1540810836","Title":"Reason to Live # 1380","Content":"POPTARTS!!! - Guest Submission(Please don’t add negative comments to these posts.)","Author":"randomreasonstolive","URL":"https://randomreasonstolive.tumblr.com/post/179549897974/reason-to-live-1380","Likes":"55","Views":"0","Direct_Post":"0"},{"Keyword":"Depression","Platform":"Tumblr","Created_time":"1540782041","Title":"Reason to Live # 1379","Content":"Going to a concert or a theater show. - Guest Submission(Please don’t add negative comments to these posts.)","Author":"randomreasonstolive","URL":"https://randomreasonstolive.tumblr.com/post/179540048785/reason-to-live-1379","Likes":"101","Views":"0","Direct_Post":"0"},{"Keyword":"Depression","Platform":"Tumblr","Created_time":"1540767646","Title":"Reason to Live # 1378","Content":"Brainstorming more story ideas for your homebrew session in D&amp;D!(Please don’t add negative comments to these posts.)","Author":"randomreasonstolive","URL":"https://randomreasonstolive.tumblr.com/post/179533128760/reason-to-live-1378","Likes":"53","Views":"0","Direct_Post":"0"},{"Keyword":"Depression","Platform":"Tumblr","Created_time":"1540756021","Title":"no title","Content":"bloodytales:\n\nTeach boys about periodsMy mother also talked about periods to my brothers. When I first got mine I had terrible cramps. Crippling cramps. I once was camping with my family and a few of my big brother’s friends when my period came. My cramps were so bad that my mom gave me a full pain killer ( I was 13 and before that she only gave me pills cut in half). I literally laid down on my parents’ air mattress and cried in pain for an hour before the pill kicked in. My brothers friend came in to the big tent and I was just curled up and sobbing. Now, I was quite the tomboy and was known to rough house with my brothers and their friends and made sure I wasnt seen as just “a little girl.” So my brother’s friend was confused to see me openly weeping in the fetal position (seriously, these were the worst cramps I have had in my life. My vision went white). He asked what was wrong with me.My big brother stood up immediately and suggested a nice long hike. During this hike I am sure he had a pretty awkward conversation with his friend explaining menstrual cramps, because when they got back the pain pill had (mostly) kicked in and I was sitting up at a table when my brother’s friend sheepishly asked me if I was feeling better. I said I was better, and he said good. When we made s'mores that night my brother and his friend kept me well supplied with chocolate.Making sure sons know as much about periods and menstruation as daughters makes them better brothers, better sons better fathers, and better men. A man that understands a period will not lightly accuse a woman of “being on her period” if the woman is in an argument.Raise better sons Teach them about normal bodily functions.","Author":"randomreasonstolive","URL":"https://randomreasonstolive.tumblr.com/post/179527193060/teach-boys-about-periods","Likes":"197076","Views":"0","Direct_Post":"0"},{"Keyword":"Depression","Platform":"Tumblr","Created_time":"1540953858","Title":"no title","Content":"mindlessventing:\n\ntheartofbecomingamess:honestly?

No eating after 7. No eating white carbs. No this. No that. But, the more you focus on the ‘no’s, the more you want them and that’s where binging comes in to play and going mental. But, honestly it makes it so much harder. What I’ve found is actually the opposite. Not being restrictive, in the sense of not letting these thoughts be so consistently present throughout the day, is what has helped me eat less. If you build of the mentality that you don’t care, and you don’t want it and you don’t feel like eating. It’s so much easier and you’re not thinking about food all the time. You think about other more important things in life, while still being able to lose the weight you want. Just don’t focus on it so much, and eat little bit of healthy food. stay safe everyone.\n\nYes oh my god yes. This is SO important. I’m just coming out of a pretty shitty week and let me tell you the #1 thing that brought me out of it is that I started thinking “I don’t want that food” instead of “I can’t let myself eat that food” and it’s changed everything. I’ve dropped a pound in two days whereas I’d actually GAINED a pound over the course of a whole week because I was motivating myself the wrong way.\n\nI do ‘I won’t eat a pizza’ instead of ‘I can’t eat pizza’. So helpful bc it no longer feels like a rule\n\n🌻\n\nFloat on\n","Author":"thinhip","URL":"https://thinhip.tumblr.com/post/179607054670/the-trick-to-starving","Likes":"8441","Views":"0","Direct_Post":"0"},{"Keyword":"Depression","Platform":"Tumblr","Created_time":"1540952510","Title":"no title","Content":"nobody-knowsss:\n\nRepeat after me:eating disorders are defined by a persons disordered thoughts and eating habits, not their weight or appearance","Author":"thinhip","URL":"https://thinhip.tumblr.com/post/179607039735/repeat-after-me","Likes":"2835","Views":"0","Direct_Post":"0"},{"Keyword":"Depression","Platform":"Tumblr","Created_time":"1540952501","Title":"reblog if you’re scared to weigh yourself","Content":"","Author":"thinhip","URL":"https://thinhip.tumblr.com/post/179607036020/reblog-if-youre-scared-to-weigh-yourself","Likes":"21716","Views":"0","Direct_Post":"0"},{"Keyword":"Depression","Platform":"Tumblr","Created_time":"1540928589","Title":"no title","Content":"I&rsquo;d like to die without feeling pain.

Until then\nShut the fuck up\n\n\nThat’s where you are wrong. Do you even know what actually cisphobia is? Some of you are real hypocrites,  so I think that you should be the one to \nShut the fuck up\n\n\nLooks like I can check “Piss off a cishet who thinks cisphobia exists” off my to do list lol\n\n\nI’m not a cishet ,thank you very much,  just because I haven’t talking about anything like that in my bio doesn’t mean that I am a cishet. Also cisphobia does exist, just like any other thing,  people on here to hate so called “cishets” . It’s only hate and it does exist, it doesn’t have to be murder ffs \nAnyway folks cisphobia don’t exist and won’t unless cis people start actually getting oppressed. \n\nOkay but, do you even know what cisphobia is?  It’s hate towards cis people.  And cishets didn’t chose to be cis nor hetero \n\nGod you people wanna be oppressed so bad.\n\nI mean excuse you? What? Just because I think hate towards cis people exist doesn’t make me cis\n\nOh my bad. I usually only hear that kind of dumbass statements coming from a cis person. \n\nPeople still do hate on cis people ,that’s my statement and you can’t prove me wrong, because it’s hate,  it doesn’t have to be violence, that’s my point all along \n\nAs a cis person, shut the fuck up. We’re not oppressed. Cisphobia isn’t a thing. When people start killing us for being cis, then we’ll talk. We are the most god damn privileged bunch of fuckwads on the planet. Don’t erase the real fear and pain trans people go through. It’s disgusting.\n\n👏👏👏","Author":"chaotic-fox-fuckery","URL":"https://chaotic-fox-fuckery.tumblr.com/post/179619274913/hi-hello-just-your-daily-reminder-that","Likes":"74","Views":"0","Direct_Post":"0"},{"Keyword":"Depression","Platform":"Tumblr","Created_time":"1540989493","Title":"no title","Content":"awkwardsonicphotos:\n\nHrmmmmm","Author":"chaotic-fox-fuckery","URL":"https://chaotic-fox-fuckery.tumblr.com/post/179619232708/hrmmmmm","Likes":"67","Views":"0","Direct_Post":"0"},{"Keyword":"Depression","Platform":"Tumblr","Created_time":"1540989320","Title":"no title","Content":"pockyiistick:\n\nheal 💓","Author":"chaotic-fox-fuckery","URL":"https://chaotic-fox-fuckery.tumblr.com/post/179619177053/heal","Likes":"6878","Views":"0","Direct_Post":"0"},{"Keyword":"Depression","Platform":"Tumblr","Created_time":"1540989238","Title":"no title","Content":"hey-lazuli-hey-lapis:\nHappy Halloween guys\n","Author":"chaotic-fox-fuckery","URL":"https://chaotic-fox-fuckery.tumblr.com/post/179619149318/hey-lazuli-hey-lapis-happy-halloween-guys","Likes":"9","Views":"0","Direct_Post":"0"},{"Keyword":"Depression","Platform":"Tumblr","Created_time":"1540989229","Title":"no title","Content":"yupokaysuremhm:\n*kICKS DOWN THE DOOR*\nHAPPY\n*SMASHES OPEN THE WINDOWS*\nFUCKING\n*SLAMS THE TABLE INTO SMITHEREENS*\n\nHALLOWEEN\n\n","Author":"chaotic-fox-fuckery","URL":"https://chaotic-fox-fuckery.tumblr.com/post/179619146803/kicks-down-the-door","Likes":"13","Views":"0","Direct_Post":"0"},{"Keyword":"Depression","Platform":"Tumblr","Created_time":"1540989210","Title":"how many posts i got through in sfw tags before seeing nsfw","Content":"lolbiit:\n\nprincess–kinkshamer:\n\nwith safe search off:pink - 0princess - 0cute - 0 or 7, depending on what you countsparkle - 0 (it was p*rn of a child character too!)baby - 20kitten - 2kitties - 0safe search on:pink - 2princess - 4cute - 0 or 10, again depending (one was lingerie, one was porn)sparkle - ~20 baby - i didnt see any! nicekitten - 2To reiterate I am 14. Your kink is not staying in the bedroom.

Stretch it out. Remind yourself that saying no is easy\n🌿 going without makes you appreciate things more. I’ve never been an apple person, but a green apple after a fast is so sweet, so pure, so cold. \n🌿 when school and sports and work are all making you feel out of control, restricting puts some power in your tired hands \n🌿 not everyone has prominent collarbones and that’s okay! I can’t see my collarbones even when I’m very thin. Love the things you do have- I love my hip bones and my long neck and high cheekbones. \n🌿 when you really feel like bingeing, get out of the way of food. I take a walk and call someone I love. I go visit the pond on campus. I go study at the library \n🌿 you can set reminders on iPhones that alert you when you are near a certain place. My favorite cafe has a reminder now, a sweet reminder gently telling me how far I’ve come, that I don’t need a croissant, how close I am\n🌿 lemon water after eating really helps. It also helps to drink tea or coffee before you eat, and let it settle\n🌿 try not to mention your weight loss. Don’t make others feel bad by saying you’ve not been hungry or haven’t eaten. It’s not your place to hurt others in this way \n🌿use happy scale! It’s an incredible app that takes the stress off of daily weigh ins; even if you gain, your overall “moving average” will go down and it’s really inspirational \n🌿 write your own imagines that are more specific than the ones on this site. Use names that matter to you, little details that feel real\n🌿try halo top ice cream! If you are craving sweet, a whole pint is in the 200 calorie range\n🌿 some days are harder than others. Forgive yourself and move on. Know that maintaining is as good of a goal as you can achieve some days and that’s okay honey\n🌿 if you are feeling absolutely terrible and you have anxiety, try kava kava root. It saves my life\n🌿it is going to be really frustrating when none of your jeans fit. I know it seems like that would be a victory, but clothes that used to be your favorites will not look good on your new body and shopping is expensive. \n🌿 one thing that encourages lot of people is trying on clothes you used to wear all the time and seeing how big they look. Progress\n🌿 weight loss is slower than you think it is. Unless you have an app like happy scale, you are not going to get an accurate view of your weight trends and daily weigh ins will be stressful \n🌿remember what you wanted to weigh when you were at your start weight and please don’t go past that. As I approach my ugw, a voice whispers g o  l o w e r. And I have to remind myself that back when I was healthy, I thought ( blank ) was a good ugw. So now that I’m sick, I try to listen to my older self and not drop too far \nI love you all, stay safe\n","Author":"despressedskeleton","URL":"https://despressedskeleton.tumblr.com/post/179479047680/things-ive-learned-after-dropping-26-lbs","Likes":"7207","Views":"0","Direct_Post":"0"},{"Keyword":"Depression","Platform":"Tumblr","Created_time":"1540491376","Title":"no title","Content":"&ldquo;إن مع العسر يسرى&rdquo;and with hardship comes ease ","Author":"abitofdarkness","URL":"https://abitofdarkness.tumblr.com/post/179423881428/إن-مع-العسر-يسرى-and-with-hardship-comes-ease","Likes":"5","Views":"0","Direct_Post":"0"},{"Keyword":"Depression","Platform":"Tumblr","Created_time":"1540405957","Title":"no title","Content":"if it wasn’t a sin, i wouldve been gone long agoif it wasn’t a sin, you wouldn’t see me here if it wasn’t a sin. god, i wish it wasnt a sin.","Author":"abitofdarkness","URL":"https://abitofdarkness.tumblr.com/post/179390250538/if-it-wasnt-a-sin-i-wouldve-been-gone-long","Likes":"8","Views":"0","Direct_Post":"0"},{"Keyword":"Depression","Platform":"Tumblr","Created_time":"1540405353","Title":"no title","Content":"and depression is heavy tonight ","Author":"abitofdarkness","URL":"https://abitofdarkness.tumblr.com/post/179389966723/and-depression-is-heavy-tonight","Likes":"248","Views":"0","Direct_Post":"1"},{"Keyword":"Depression","Platform":"Tumblr","Created_time":"1540405262","Title":"no title","Content":"you feel the emptiness travel to your head and from your head to your body. and its so weird but you do feel it, it makes you feel like all of your body temp is increasing or decreasing at once. you want to close your eyes and sleep or probably just die. but you couldn’t because you still have stuff to do, because you have responsibilities. but you do neither because depression is a fucking asshole ","Author":"abitofdarkness","URL":"https://abitofdarkness.tumblr.com/post/179389924458/you-feel-the-emptiness-travel-to-your-head-and","Likes":"5","Views":"0","Direct_Post":"0"},{"Keyword":"Depression","Platform":"Tumblr","Created_time":"1540158639","Title":"no title","Content":"to anyone who’s considering suicide YOU MOTHERFUCKING STRONG LOVELY ASSHOLE THAT GRABBED LIFE BY THE TITS FOR SO MANY YEARS. im proud of you, so much for still holding on, dont let go. dont! dont you dare. imagine your hand is slipping off a cliff like in some movie and your hand is letting go because it became sweaty and everything is slipping but then at last fucking millisecond someone comes and pulls you up. this is me pulling you up.

No one is going to say “They gave us $10, they must disrespect us and our traditions.” Unless you give, like, literally the Nazi numbers (*gestures at Milo*), they’re going to say “How kind that this person thought of us at all.”\n(2) If you want to donate a multiple of chai but $18 or $36 or whatever is out of your price range, $1.80 (or multiples thereof) also carries with it same meaning. On behalf of every broke Jewish grad student, I can vouch for the fact that this is 1000% acceptable and welcome.\n(3) You even thinking about giving to the Jewish community means a lot.

(Long post)","Content":"You seem pretty well versed on mental health issues, so I was hoping you could provice some advice!\nUsually, this is the kind of thing I’d bring to my therapist, but she is unfortunately on maternity leave at the moment. I know there’s a huge difference between some rando on Tumblr and a licensed therapist, but at this point, I’ll take whatever I can get. Even unprofessional advice might be helpful.\nI have GAD and I very likely have ADHD (legally undiagnosed, but my therapist is sure I have it and is trying to get me a diagnosis) as well as some other underlying mental health issues that I still have no fucking clue about. Like I mentioned, I see a therapist regularly most of the time, and I have been for over a year. So I should know what my symptoms are, right? RIGHT?!\nApparently not. Because recently I learned about a massive issue I’ve had for almost as long as I can remember. And, somehow, I have never noticed it until now.\nGet this: I rip up paper. And I connect my letters absentmindedly when I zone out. Sounds harmless, yes? It’s not.\nI have torn up pages of homework. I have taken handwritten essays that needed to be turned in the next day and “doodled” over them to the point that the letters are unrecognizable. When I was a kid, I would ruin the covers of my favorite books and then become furious over something that was my own fault. Most of my notebooks don’t have covers. All of my jackets have pockets full of shredded paper. I’ve literally failed tests when I knew the material because the paper I handed in just had a bunch of scribbles where the answers should have been. And a lot of the time I’ll even combine the two, finding old worksheets that I’ve ruined with my “doodling” and slowly tearing them to shreds.\nI thought it was stimming or self-soothing because it makes me feel calm. It’s viscerally satisfying in some arbitrary way, so yes, it does help with my anxiety. But what I didn’t realize is that it also causes anxiety. It isn’t just a coping mechanism. I am no longer in control of the situation. When I see a word I’ve written in a certain way, I need to connect all the lines. When a paper is creased, I need to rip it. When I don’t, I feel anxious and uncomfortable and… sort of twitchy. It’s like my whole being just wants me to do the destructive habit. I can’t not do it. I can’t stop thinking about it.\nI feel completely helpless and miserable. I know it’s just paper, I can just type, etc. But isn’t there something wrong? I’ve never heard of these types of symptoms, and I can’t really connect them to my ADHD or GAD, although maybe that’s just an oversight on my part. My point is that I really don’t know what’s going on, but I need help. Any advice at all is appreciated. Thank you.Hello there, dear!Oddly enough my therapist is on maternity leave too! So that bit made me smile. :)I’ll let you in on a little secret: It took me 9 years of seeing a therapist before I was finally diagnosed properly. From 16 - 26 I had been told I had Bipolar disorder, until someone finally realized I actually have Borderline Personality Disorder, or BPD.Mental health is like a journey with no map. Therapists are there to help you by giving you directions, or techniques, or to even help you discover those things on your own. But therapists can be wrong and point you in the wrong direction, or not know what direction you need. It takes quite some time to figure out the journey that is your illness, but I’m proud of you for what you’ve done so far!These things do seem like stimming to me, though I am no expert on it. From my understanding, however, stims can be both helpful and harmful. They help to deal with anxiety in the moment, but the after effects can cause that to backfire. It sounds like this struggle has become overwhelming. You may want to look into seeing a temporary therapist while yours is away on leave. Also, have you seen a doctor about medications? Not all medication for anxiety is good, but some of it can be very helpful.It’s not “just paper”. If it’s something you’re struggling with, then it’s an issue, and it matters. Something is clearly wrong and needs to be addressed.Are you still in school? If so, you may want to get your parents to look into an alternative learning program.. Speak with a school adviser / school counselor about finding teachers who are more understanding of the situation. Make sure you have someone advocating for you if there are issues.Try to narrow down what causes you to be stressed so you can learn to prepare for those situations. For example, if you are going to be taking a test, ask if you can have some extra notebook paper to quietly shred and doodle on so that you aren’t doing so on the test itself. Maybe get a new notebook specifically dedicated for your doodling/shredding, so you can avoid tearing apart any of your other ones. These will be conscious choices you will have to learn to make, but it will be much easier than just forcing yourself not to tear things. It might be difficult, but it will be worth it. Mental Health is about growing, one day at a time, one step at a time. You can also look into other sorts of stimming, be it toys or not. There are quite a few very nice stim toys online (Wish is where we got ours) and while it does take some getting used to, they are nice to keep your hands busy with. You can also do things like fold up bits of paper, or fidget with a piece of string/hair tie, etc. Something that isn’t disruptive or harmful to yourself or your life.I really hope this has been helpful. If anyone else with more experience with stimming has anything to add, please do!I love you and I really hope you’re able to get to a healthier place soon!- N","Author":"randomreasonstolive","URL":"https://randomreasonstolive.tumblr.com/post/179560952880/advice-long-post","Likes":"23","Views":"0","Direct_Post":"0"},{"Keyword":"Depression","Platform":"Tumblr","Created_time":"1540825233","Title":"Reason to Live # 1381","Content":"Cuddles from my dog make it worth living. - Guest Submission(Please don’t add negative comments to these posts.)","Author":"randomreasonstolive","URL":"https://randomreasonstolive.tumblr.com/post/179555067086/reason-to-live-1381","Likes":"125","Views":"0","Direct_Post":"0"},{"Keyword":"Depression","Platform":"Tumblr","Created_time":"1540810836","Title":"Reason to Live # 1380","Content":"POPTARTS!!! - Guest Submission(Please don’t add negative comments to these posts.)","Author":"randomreasonstolive","URL":"https://randomreasonstolive.tumblr.com/post/179549897974/reason-to-live-1380","Likes":"55","Views":"0","Direct_Post":"0"},{"Keyword":"Depression","Platform":"Tumblr","Created_time":"1540782041","Title":"Reason to Live # 1379","Content":"Going to a concert or a theater show. - Guest Submission(Please don’t add negative comments to these posts.)","Author":"randomreasonstolive","URL":"https://randomreasonstolive.tumblr.com/post/179540048785/reason-to-live-1379","Likes":"101","Views":"0","Direct_Post":"0"},{"Keyword":"Depression","Platform":"Tumblr","Created_time":"1540767646","Title":"Reason to Live # 1378","Content":"Brainstorming more story ideas for your homebrew session in D&amp;D!(Please don’t add negative comments to these posts.)","Author":"randomreasonstolive","URL":"https://randomreasonstolive.tumblr.com/post/179533128760/reason-to-live-1378","Likes":"53","Views":"0","Direct_Post":"0"},{"Keyword":"Depression","Platform":"Tumblr","Created_time":"1540756021","Title":"no title","Content":"bloodytales:\n\nTeach boys about periodsMy mother also talked about periods to my brothers. When I first got mine I had terrible cramps. Crippling cramps. I once was camping with my family and a few of my big brother’s friends when my period came. My cramps were so bad that my mom gave me a full pain killer ( I was 13 and before that she only gave me pills cut in half). I literally laid down on my parents’ air mattress and cried in pain for an hour before the pill kicked in. My brothers friend came in to the big tent and I was just curled up and sobbing. Now, I was quite the tomboy and was known to rough house with my brothers and their friends and made sure I wasnt seen as just “a little girl.” So my brother’s friend was confused to see me openly weeping in the fetal position (seriously, these were the worst cramps I have had in my life. My vision went white). He asked what was wrong with me.My big brother stood up immediately and suggested a nice long hike. During this hike I am sure he had a pretty awkward conversation with his friend explaining menstrual cramps, because when they got back the pain pill had (mostly) kicked in and I was sitting up at a table when my brother’s friend sheepishly asked me if I was feeling better. I said I was better, and he said good. When we made s'mores that night my brother and his friend kept me well supplied with chocolate.Making sure sons know as much about periods and menstruation as daughters makes them better brothers, better sons better fathers, and better men. A man that understands a period will not lightly accuse a woman of “being on her period” if the woman is in an argument.Raise better sons Teach them about normal bodily functions.","Author":"randomreasonstolive","URL":"https://randomreasonstolive.tumblr.com/post/179527193060/teach-boys-about-periods","Likes":"197076","Views":"0","Direct_Post":"0"},{"Keyword":"Depression","Platform":"Tumblr","Created_time":"1540933546","Title":"no title","Content":"skinny-lady-wannabe:\n\nreblog if you’re trying to lose 30+ lbs/14+ kg 🌸✨","Author":"drowning-in-emptyness","URL":"https://drowning-in-emptyness.tumblr.com/post/179598426620/reblog-if-youre-trying-to-lose-30-lbs14-kg","Likes":"1196","Views":"0","Direct_Post":"0"},{"Keyword":"Depression","Platform":"Tumblr","Created_time":"1540931765","Title":"no title","Content":"selfharmthoughtss:\n\n“i desperately want to stop existing but i cant just simply kill myself” — being suicidal is so weird","Author":"drowning-in-emptyness","URL":"https://drowning-in-emptyness.tumblr.com/post/179597618945/selfharmthoughtss-i-desperately-want-to-stop","Likes":"16275","Views":"0","Direct_Post":"0"},{"Keyword":"Depression","Platform":"Tumblr","Created_time":"1540905264","Title":"no title","Content":"bpd-anz:\nme: im so lonely\nsomeone: hey\nme: go away\n","Author":"drowning-in-emptyness","URL":"https://drowning-in-emptyness.tumblr.com/post/179586800890/bpd-anz-me-im-so-lonely-someone-hey-me-go-away","Likes":"466","Views":"0","Direct_Post":"0"},{"Keyword":"Depression","Platform":"Tumblr","Created_time":"1540901070","Title":"no title","Content":"Scrolling through thinspo whilst stuffing my face with hariboSomeone please remind me I can do this","Author":"drowning-in-emptyness","URL":"https://drowning-in-emptyness.tumblr.com/post/179585459720/scrolling-through-thinspo-whilst-stuffing-my-face","Likes":"4","Views":"0","Direct_Post":"0"},{"Keyword":"Depression","Platform":"Tumblr","Created_time":"1540826525","Title":"no title","Content":"I’m 19 years old, I should be excited about going out or whatever it is normal 19 year olds get excited about.
